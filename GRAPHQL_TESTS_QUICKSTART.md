## 🎯 What's Working

### ✅ GraphQL Client
- Connection to Supabase GraphQL endpoint
- Authentication with user session
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforcement

### ✅ Query Operations
- Fetch collections with pagination
- Filter by any field
- Sort and order results
- Fetch nested relationships in single query
- Search operations

### ✅ Converted Pages
All pages now use GraphQL for data fetching:
1. **Team Service Requests** - `useServiceRequestsGQL({ scope: 'team' })`
2. **Admin Service Requests** - `useServiceRequestsGQL({ scope: 'all' })`
3. **User Profile** - `useProfileGQL(userId)`

---

## 📝 Example Query Results

### User Profiles
```
✓ Fetched 5 profiles
  1. Anuj D (admin)
  2. Bhive Admin (admin)
  3. Mohammed zufishan (manager)
  4. Akash Kamat (user)
  5. Vansh qwe (manager)
```

### Single Profile with Relationships
```
✓ Profile fetched successfully!
  Name: Anuj D
  Email: anuj.dwivedi@kroolo.com
  Role: admin
  Organization: Kroolo Demo Organization
```

### Filtering
```
✓ Found 2 admin users
✓ Filtering by status working
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If tests fail:
1. **Check .env file** - Ensure Supabase credentials are set
2. **Check internet connection** - GraphQL endpoint needs network access
3. **Check Supabase** - Ensure your Supabase project is running

### For mutations not working:
Mutations require additional RLS policies in Supabase. The READ operations are fully functional and ready for production.
