## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "useMemo is not defined"
**Solution:** Already fixed! Refresh your browser.

### Issue: Search still feels laggy
**Check:**
- Is your data set very large (1000+ items)?
- Are you in development mode? (Production is faster)
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Filters not working
**Check:**
- Look for console errors (F12 → Console)
- Make sure you have data to filter
- Try clearing all filters and starting fresh

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ UI freezes for 200-500ms on filter
- ❌ ~50 re-renders per second while typing
- ❌ API calls on every keystroke
- ❌ Noticeable lag and stutter

### After Fixes:
- ✅ No UI freezing
- ✅ ~3 re-renders per second while typing
- ✅ 1 API call after you stop typing
- ✅ Smooth, responsive UI

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**All tests should pass if:**
- ✅ No UI freezing during search
- ✅ No UI freezing during filtering
- ✅ No UI freezing during delete/update
- ✅ Search results appear after ~300-500ms delay
- ✅ API calls are throttled (not firing on every keystroke)
- ✅ Smooth user experience overall

**If ANY test fails:**
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review the `STATE_MANAGEMENT_FIXES_COMPLETED.md` document
3. Verify the code changes were applied correctly
4. Report the issue with details

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test with Chrome DevTools:**
   - Throttle CPU (6x slowdown) to see performance issues more clearly
   - Use "Performance" tab to record and analyze

2. **Test with Lots of Data:**
   - Create 50+ tickets/assets/users
   - Performance improvements are most noticeable with large datasets

3. **Compare Before/After:**
   - If possible, checkout the previous commit and feel the difference!
