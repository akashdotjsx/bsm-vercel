# 🚀 Workflow Testing - QUICK START

## ⚡ Run Tests NOW

```bash
cd /Users/anujdwivedi/Desktop/kroolo/kroolo-bsm
npm run test:workflows
```

That's it! The test will:
1. ✅ Test all CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
2. ✅ Test workflow execution engine (conditions, validators, post-functions)
3. ✅ Test complex scenarios (sequential transitions, backward transitions)
4. ✅ Automatically clean up ALL test data

## 🎯 What Gets Tested

### 13 Comprehensive Tests:

**CRUD Operations (4 tests)**
- CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE workflows

**Execution Engine (6 tests)**
- Condition evaluation (pass & fail)
- Field validation (pass & fail)
- Post-function execution
- Full workflow transition with logs

**Complex Scenarios (3 tests)**
- Sequential transitions (To Do → In Progress → In Review)
- Backward transitions (In Review → In Progress)
- Parallel workflow paths

## 📁 What Was Created

1. **`/types/workflow.ts`** - Complete TypeScript types (460 lines)
2. **`/lib/workflow/engine.ts`** - Execution engine (670 lines)
3. **`/lib/workflow/samples.ts`** - 3 sample workflows (561 lines)
4. **`/scripts/test-workflows.js`** - Comprehensive test suite (620 lines)

## ✅ Success Criteria

- All 13 tests pass ✅
- Zero test data left in database ✅
- Completes in ~8-10 seconds ✅
- 100% automatic cleanup ✅

## 🐛 If Something Fails

1. **Check environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Verify these exist in .env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
   ```

2. **Check database connectivity**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:db  # Should work
   ```

3. **View detailed error messages** in the test output
