# Users & Teams Page - UI Improvements Summary

## Overview
Modernized the Users & Teams page by replacing old Dialog components with modern slide-in drawers, fixing badge colors, and resolving team member loading issues.

---

## 🎨 All Changes Made

### 1. **Team Members Loading Fix** ✅
**Problem:** Teams showing "0 members" even when members existed in database

**Solution:**
- Fixed property naming in `useTeamsGQL` hook
- Changed `members` to `team_members` to match page expectations
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

**File:** `hooks/use-users-gql.ts`
- Lines 236-253 updated with proper transformation

**Result:** Teams now display correct member counts and avatars

---

### 2. **Active/Inactive Badge Colors** ✅
**Problem:** Status badges too dark in dark mode, hard to read

**Solution:**
- Changed Active badge from `bg-green-950` to `bg-emerald-500/20`
- Changed Inactive badge from `bg-red-950` to `bg-red-500/20`
- Added borders for better definition
- Better contrast in both light and dark modes

**File:** `app/(dashboard)/users/page.tsx`
- Lines 829-832 updated

**Before:**
```tsx
// Dark, hard to read
bg-green-100 dark:bg-green-950 text-green-700 dark:text-green-400
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Bright, semi-transparent, with border
bg-emerald-100 dark:bg-emerald-500/20 text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400 
border border-emerald-200 dark:border-emerald-500/30
```
