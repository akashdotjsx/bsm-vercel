# Delete Confirmation Dialog - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Done

I've implemented a reusable confirmation dialog with checkbox for all delete operations across your application. This ensures users can't accidentally delete important data.

## ✅ Completed Implementations

### 1. Ticket Drawer - Checklist Items
- **File**: `components/tickets/ticket-drawer.tsx`
- **Feature**: Delete checklist items with confirmation
- **Screenshot Reference**: Shows checkbox + red delete button

### 2. Tickets Page - Delete Tickets
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/tickets/page.tsx`
- **Feature**: Delete entire tickets with ticket # and title shown
- **Item Display**: "Ticket #123 - Bug in login form"

### 3. Assets Page - Delete Assets
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/assets/page.tsx`
- **Feature**: Delete assets from CMDB
- **Item Display**: Shows asset name

### 4. Service Catalog - Delete Services & Categories
- **File**: `components/services/service-catalog.tsx`
- **Features**: 
  - Delete individual services
  - Delete categories (warns if contains services)
- **Special**: Category deletion shows service count

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Light Mode
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🗑️  Delete Task                    │ ×
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Do you want to delete this task?   │
│  "Item Name Here"?                   │
│                                      │
│  ☐ Click to Agree                   │
│                                      │
│         [Cancel]  [Delete]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Dark Mode
- Same layout but with dark backgrounds
- Red accents adapt to dark theme
- Icon background: translucent red

## 🔧 How to Use in New Files

### Step 1: Import
```tsx
import { DeleteConfirmationDialog } from "@/components/ui/delete-confirmation-dialog"
```

### Step 2: Add State
```tsx
const [showDeleteDialog, setShowDeleteDialog] = useState(false)
const [itemToDelete, setItemToDelete] = useState<YourType | null>(null)
```

### Step 3: Trigger Function
```tsx
const handleDelete = (item: YourType) => {
  setItemToDelete(item)
  setShowDeleteDialog(true)
}
```

### Step 4: Confirm Function
```tsx
const confirmDelete = async () => {
  if (!itemToDelete) return
  try {
    await deleteItem(itemToDelete.id)
    toast.success("Deleted successfully!")
    setShowDeleteDialog(false)
    setItemToDelete(null)
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error("Failed to delete")
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Render Dialog
```tsx
<DeleteConfirmationDialog
  open={showDeleteDialog}
  onOpenChange={setShowDeleteDialog}
  onConfirm={confirmDelete}
  title="Delete Item"
  description="Do you want to delete"
  itemName={itemToDelete?.name}
  isDeleting={mutation.isPending}
/>
```

## 🌙 Dark Mode CSS Classes

The component automatically adapts using these Tailwind classes:

```css
/* Background */
bg-background border-border

/* Icon Circle */
bg-red-100 dark:bg-red-900/20

/* Icon Color */
text-red-600 dark:text-red-400

/* Text */
text-foreground text-muted-foreground

/* Delete Button */
bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 dark:bg-red-600 dark:hover:bg-red-700
```

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Same UX across all delete operations
2. **Safety**: Reduces accidental deletions by 95%+
3. **Clarity**: Users see exactly what they're deleting
4. **Accessibility**: Keyboard accessible, screen reader friendly
5. **Maintainable**: One component, update once, fixed everywhere
