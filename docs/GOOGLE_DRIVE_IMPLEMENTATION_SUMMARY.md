## Supported File Formats

- **Google Docs** (auto-exported to .docx)
- **Microsoft Word** (.docx, .doc)
- **Text files** (.txt)
- **Markdown** (.md)
- **HTML** (.html, .htm)

## Architecture Highlights

### Backend
- Uses Pipedream SDK for OAuth and API proxy
- All routes authenticate via Supabase
- No file storage on server (memory processing only)
- Secure token management via Pipedream

### Frontend
- React hooks for state management
- useMemo for Pipedream client initialization
- useCallback for optimized event handlers
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components for consistency

### Integration Points
- Reuses existing `/api/knowledge/import` endpoint
- Compatible with current AI enhancement pipeline
- Shares form state with other import methods
- Consistent UX across all import methods

## Configuration Required

Add to `.env.local`:
```env
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT=development
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

Get credentials from: https://pipedream.com/

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Install @pipedream/sdk package
- [x] Create Pipedream utilities
- [x] Create API routes (token, files, download)
- [x] Create GoogleDriveBrowser component
- [x] Integrate into knowledge base page
- [x] Add file download and parsing logic
- [ ] Manual testing (requires Pipedream setup):
  - [ ] Connect Google Drive
  - [ ] Browse folders
  - [ ] Navigate breadcrumbs
  - [ ] Select files
  - [ ] Ingest documents
  - [ ] Verify parsing and AI enhancement
  - [ ] Test reconnection on page refresh

## Usage Flow

1. User navigates to Knowledge Base â†’ New Article
2. Clicks "Google Drive" tab
3. Clicks "Connect Google Drive" button
4. Authorizes app in Pipedream popup
5. Browses folders and files
6. Selects supported documents
7. Clicks "Ingest X Files" button
8. System downloads and processes files
9. Form auto-populated with extracted content
10. User reviews and saves article

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- Processes one file at a time
- 20 files/folders per view
- No search functionality
- No file preview

### Potential Enhancements
- Batch file processing
- Search within Drive
- File preview modal
- Automatic folder sync
- Support for more formats
- Export back to Drive
- Shared drives support
- File caching

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading with pagination (20 items)
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Optimistic UI updates
- Client-side caching of folder structure
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks

## Security Features

1. User authentication required (Supabase)
2. Per-user connection isolation
3. Secure token management (Pipedream)
4. No server-side file storage
5. OAuth 2.0 for Google Drive access
6. HTTPS for all API calls

## Cost Implications

- Pipedream free tier includes limited API calls
- Monitor usage via Pipedream dashboard
- Consider rate limiting for production
- No additional Google Cloud costs (uses Pipedream proxy)

## Next Steps

1. Set up Pipedream account and get credentials
2. Add environment variables
3. Test the integration manually
4. Consider adding analytics/tracking
5. Monitor API usage
6. Gather user feedback
7. Implement enhancements based on usage
