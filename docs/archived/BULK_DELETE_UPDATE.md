# Bulk Delete Update - Professional Confirmation Dialog

## üéØ Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Replaced Native Alert with Professional UI
- ‚ùå **Before**: Used browser's native `confirm()` alert (not user-friendly)
- ‚úÖ **After**: Uses existing `DeleteConfirmationDialog` component with beautiful UI

### ‚úÖ Now Using GraphQL Mutations
- ‚ùå **Before**: Used wrapped `deleteTicket()` function
- ‚úÖ **After**: Directly uses `deleteTicketMutation.mutateAsync(id)` for each ticket

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Confirmation Dialog Features

The bulk delete now shows a professional dialog with:

1. **Dynamic Message**: "Do you want to delete X tickets" (shows actual count)
2. **Checkbox Confirmation**: User must check "I understand this action cannot be undone"
3. **Visual Feedback**: Red trash icon, proper styling
4. **Loading State**: Shows "Deleting..." while processing
5. **Disabled Actions**: Can't cancel or close during deletion
6. **Proper Pluralization**: "1 ticket" vs "4 tickets"

## üìã Implementation Details

### New State Variables (tickets page.tsx)
```typescript
const [showBulkDeleteDialog, setShowBulkDeleteDialog] = useState(false)
const [bulkDeleteTicketIds, setBulkDeleteTicketIds] = useState<string[]>([])
const [isBulkDeleting, setIsBulkDeleting] = useState(false)
```

### Updated Handlers

#### 1. Bulk Delete Request Handler
```typescript
const handleBulkDeleteRequest = (ticketIds: string[]) => {
  console.log('üóëÔ∏è Bulk delete requested for tickets:', ticketIds)
  setBulkDeleteTicketIds(ticketIds)
  setShowBulkDeleteDialog(true)
}
```

#### 2. Confirm Bulk Delete Handler
```typescript
const confirmBulkDelete = async () => {
  if (bulkDeleteTicketIds.length === 0) return
  
  setIsBulkDeleting(true)
  
  try {
    // Delete using GraphQL mutation
    for (const id of bulkDeleteTicketIds) {
      await deleteTicketMutation.mutateAsync(id)
    }
    
    toast.success(
      `${bulkDeleteTicketIds.length} ticket${bulkDeleteTicketIds.length > 1 ? 's' : ''} deleted successfully`,
      'The selected tickets have been removed'
    )
    
    setShowBulkDeleteDialog(false)
    setBulkDeleteTicketIds([])
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in bulk delete:', error)
    toast.error('Failed to delete some tickets')
  } finally {
    setIsBulkDeleting(false)
  }
}
```

### Dialog Implementation
```tsx
<DeleteConfirmationDialog
  open={showBulkDeleteDialog}
  onOpenChange={setShowBulkDeleteDialog}
  onConfirm={confirmBulkDelete}
  title="Delete Multiple Tickets"
  description={`Do you want to delete ${bulkDeleteTicketIds.length} ticket${bulkDeleteTicketIds.length > 1 ? 's' : ''}`}
  requireCheckbox={true}
  checkboxLabel="I understand this action cannot be undone"
  isDeleting={isBulkDeleting}
/>
```

## üîÑ Also Updated: Bulk Update

The bulk update handler now also uses GraphQL mutations:

```typescript
const handleBulkUpdate = async (ticketIds: string[], updates: any) => {
  try {
    for (const id of ticketIds) {
      await updateTicketMutation.mutateAsync({ id, updates })
    }
    
    toast.success(
      `${ticketIds.length} ticket${ticketIds.length > 1 ? 's' : ''} updated successfully`,
      'The selected tickets have been updated'
    )
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to update some tickets')
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits
