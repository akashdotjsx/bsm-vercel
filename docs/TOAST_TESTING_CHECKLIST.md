# Toast Testing Checklist

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue: Toasts Not Showing on Tickets Page

**Root Causes Found:**
1. ❌ Duplicate `SonnerToaster` in layout causing conflicts
2. ❌ Wrong toast call format (using object with `description` and `duration` instead of two string parameters)

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ Removed duplicate `SonnerToaster` from `app/layout.tsx`
2. ✅ Fixed 4 toast calls in `app/(dashboard)/tickets/page.tsx` to use correct format
3. ✅ All delete operations now use `toast.error()` (red) instead of `toast.success()`

## 🎯 Expected Toast Formats

### Correct Format (Two String Parameters)
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
toast.success('Title here', 'Description here')
toast.error('Error title', 'Error details')

// ✅ CORRECT (Single parameter)
toast.success('Simple message')
toast.error('Simple error')
```

### Incorrect Format (Object with Properties)
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Will NOT work
toast.success('Title', {
  description: 'Description',
  duration: 5000
})

// ❌ WRONG - Will NOT work
toast.error('Error', {
  description: 'Details'
})
```

## 🔍 Debugging Toasts

### If Toasts Don't Appear:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   ```
   F12 → Console tab → Look for errors
   ```

2. **Verify Toaster is Mounted**
   - Open `app/layout.tsx`
   - Confirm line contains: `<Toaster />`
   - Should be INSIDE the providers but OUTSIDE the main content

3. **Check Toast Import**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ CORRECT
   import { toast } from '@/lib/toast'
   
   // ❌ WRONG
   import { toast } from 'sonner'
   import { useToast } from '@/hooks/use-toast'
   ```

4. **Inspect DOM**
   - Right-click page → Inspect
   - Look for element with `[data-radix-toast-viewport]`
   - Should be present in DOM tree

5. **Check Z-Index**
   - Toast viewport has `z-index: 100`
   - Make sure nothing covers it
