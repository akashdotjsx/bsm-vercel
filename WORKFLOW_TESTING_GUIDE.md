# 🧪 Workflow System - Complete Testing Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide provides complete instructions for testing the Jira-style workflow system, including CRUD operations, execution engine, conditions, validators, and post-functions.

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. Sample Workflow Data

### 2. Workflow Execution Engine
✅ **File**: `/lib/workflow/engine.ts`
- Production-ready execution engine (670 lines)
- 8 condition types
- 6 validator types
- 11 post-function types
- Complete execution logging

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
✅ **File**: `/scripts/test-workflows.js`
- CRUD operations testing (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Workflow execution engine testing
- Condition evaluation (pass/fail scenarios)
- Validator testing (pass/fail scenarios)
- Post-function execution
- Complex workflow scenarios
- Sequential transitions
- Backward transitions
- Automatic cleanup of test data

### 4. TypeScript Types
✅ **File**: `/types/workflow.ts`
- 460 lines of comprehensive types
- Full type safety throughout

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/anujdwivedi/Desktop/kroolo/kroolo-bsm

# Run complete workflow test suite
npm run test:workflows
```

### Alternative Commands

```bash
# Same test (aliases)
npm run test:workflows:crud
npm run test:workflows:engine
```

## 📊 What Gets Tested

### 1. CRUD Operations (4 tests)
- ✅ **CREATE** - Create workflow in database
- ✅ **READ** - Retrieve workflow from database
- ✅ **UPDATE** - Update workflow status and version
- ✅ **DELETE** - Delete workflow and verify removal

### 2. Execution Engine (6 tests)
- ✅ **Condition Pass** - Successful condition evaluation
- ✅ **Condition Fail** - Failed condition (correctly rejected)
- ✅ **Validator Pass** - Successful validation
- ✅ **Validator Fail** - Failed validation (correctly rejected with errors)
- ✅ **Post Functions** - Post-function execution
- ✅ **Full Transition** - Complete transition with execution logs

### 3. Complex Scenarios (3 tests)
- ✅ **Multiple Transitions** - Sequential workflow transitions
- ✅ **Backward Transition** - Moving backwards in workflow
- ✅ **Parallel Paths** - Complex workflow paths

### Total: **13 comprehensive tests**

## 🔍 Test Details

### CRUD Test Sequence

1. **CREATE**: Creates a workflow with sample service workflow definition
2. **READ**: Retrieves the workflow and verifies data integrity
3. **UPDATE**: Changes workflow status to 'active' and version to 2
4. **DELETE**: Removes workflow and confirms deletion

### Execution Engine Tests

#### Condition Pass Test
- Creates simple workflow
- Tests transition with valid user permissions
- Verifies conditions pass correctly

#### Condition Fail Test
- Tests transition without required permissions
- Verifies conditions fail correctly
- Checks error messages

#### Validator Pass Test
- Uses approval workflow
- Tests with valid field data (title > 5 chars, description > 20 chars)
- Verifies validators pass

#### Validator Fail Test
- Tests with invalid data (too short)
- Verifies validators fail
- Checks validation error messages

#### Post-Function Test
- Tests status updates
- Tests assignee updates
- Tests resolution setting
- Tests notifications

#### Full Transition Test
- Complete workflow transition
- Verifies execution logging
- Checks log entry count

### Complex Scenario Tests

#### Multiple Transitions
- To Do → In Progress (with permission condition)
- In Progress → In Review (with comment validator)
- Verifies state changes
- Checks condition and validator enforcement

#### Backward Transition
- In Review → In Progress (Request Changes)
- Verifies backward movement
- Checks correct target step

#### Parallel Paths
- Tests workflow with multiple possible transitions
- Verifies each path works independently

## 🧹 Automatic Cleanup

The test script includes comprehensive cleanup:

✅ **Automatic cleanup after tests**
- Deletes all workflow executions
- Deletes all workflows
- Deletes all test tickets
- Deletes all test organizations

✅ **Emergency cleanup on interruption** (Ctrl+C)
- Handles SIGINT signal
- Cleans up all test data
- Safe exit

✅ **No test data left behind**
- 100% cleanup guarantee
- Safe for production databases (uses separate test org)

## 🔑 Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

The tests use the service role key to bypass RLS policies for testing purposes.

## 📚 Sample Workflows

```
To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done
         ↑              ↓

           (Request Changes)
```

**Features**:

           (Revise & Resubmit)
```

**Features**:
- 4 statuses

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Test Failures

**Issue**: CREATE test fails
```
Error: CREATE failed: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
```
**Solution**: Previous test data wasn't cleaned up. Run cleanup:
```bash
# Manual cleanup if needed
npm run test:db  # Uses existing cleanup
```

**Issue**: Permission errors
```
Error: new row violates row-level security policy
```
**Solution**: Verify service role key in `.env`

**Issue**: Connection timeout
```
Error: Connection refused
```
**Solution**: Check Supabase URL and network connection

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
# Add debug flag (modify script if needed)
DEBUG=true npm run test:workflows
```

Check execution logs:
- Logs are included in test output
- Each transition logs: start, conditions, validators, post-functions, completion

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

Add to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Workflow Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Run workflow tests
        run: npm run test:workflows
        env:
          NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}
          SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY }}
```

## 📖 Next Steps

### 1. Run Tests
```bash
npm run test:workflows
```

### 2. Review Results
Check the test output for any failures

### 3. Verify Cleanup
Confirm no test data remains:
```bash
# Check your database
# All test organizations should be removed
```

### 4. Integration
Integrate workflows into your application:
- Use the workflow engine in your API routes
- Call workflows from ticket/service request transitions
- Display workflow status in UI
