## 🚫 INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

### Auth Pages
- **app/auth/login/page.tsx** - Uses `window.location` for security (intentional)
- **app/setup-admin/page.tsx** - Setup page with anchor tags (one-time use, acceptable)

**Reason:** Authentication pages require full page refresh after login to properly initialize session, which is a security best practice.

## 📝 NOTES

1. **GraphQL + React Query:** Most pages use GraphQL with React Query for data fetching, which provides automatic caching and prevents unnecessary refetches on navigation.

2. **Prefetching:** The sidebar includes prefetch hooks (`usePrefetchTicketsGraphQL`, `usePrefetchUsers`) that pre-load data on hover for even faster navigation.

3. **State Preservation:** All React state (filters, search terms, modal states) is preserved when navigating between pages because the app shell remains mounted.

4. **Performance:** The app now behaves like a true SPA with instant route transitions and no page flicker.

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**ALL PAGES FROM YOUR SIDEBAR MENU ARE NOW USING PROPER REACT NAVIGATION!**

The sidebar and navbar will never refresh when navigating between pages. Users get a seamless, instant navigation experience throughout the entire application.

**Status: COMPLETE & VERIFIED ✅**
